PROBLEM STATEMENT: 

In Digital Electronics and Information Technology sectors, storage and transmission of data is an integral part of the computation process. Memory storage elements (like registers) are built using Sequential Logic. The storage elements are implemented on the chip level with the help of Transistors. Simulate the basic sequential memory building block in Proteus, using only Transistors and other circuit elements, as required.

GUIDELINES: 
 
• Usage of any kind of available ICs in Proteus library is NOT allowed. 
• A proper explanation of the implementation must be provided in a separate PDF file.

COMPONENTS REQUIRED:

• Transistors, Power supply, Function generator, Oscilloscope, other circuit elements (like capacitors etc.) if needed. 
• Proteus Circuit Simulator software
